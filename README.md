# 🚀 Discord Auto Claim Faucet

This code is used to automatically claim faucets by sending messages to multiple configured Discord channels. It also handles **rate limits** and **slow mode** automatically.

## 📌 Key Features
- 🔑 **Uses Token from `.env`** for security.
- 💬 **Sends messages to multiple channels** based on configuration.
- ⏳ **Handles Slow Mode & Rate Limits** automatically.
- 📝 **Allows users to add new channels directly from the CLI**.
- 🔄 **Multi-threading** to handle slow mode without blocking other processes.
- 📜 **Logs** all bot activity in `bot.log`.

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the bot for the first time. It will automatically create a `.env` file and prompt you to enter your **DISCORD_TOKEN**, which will then be saved in the `.env` file:
   ```sh
   python bot.py
   ```

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   python auto.py
   ```
2. Select an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Sends messages to all configured channels.

   - `3`: Exits the bot.

## 📌 Important Notes
- Ensure the user has **permissions** to send messages in the selected channels.
- If **rate limited**, the code will wait before resending messages.
- Selecting **Option 2** allows users to add a new channel, which will be automatically saved in `.env`.
